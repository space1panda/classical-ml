    "The process of training machine learning model (approximating the distribution of random variables) happens simultaneously with mnimizing the amount of knowledge that can be \"learnt\" by the model from the given training dataset. In the ideal case, when dataset contains total number of states of rv, the amount of gained knowledge from the dataset fully describes the uncertainty represented by the rv. The information about the amount of gained knowledge can be quantified and used in both classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of knowledge, that can be learnt from observing rv, is also called entropy, and information entropy in case of data. This concept originates from thernodynamics, where it describes the degree of disorder, which appears internally in materials (gases, liquids) or when different materials interact. We do not need to go into any further understanding here\n"
